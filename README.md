### Learnings?!

- accesibility adds a lot of text in the html file, huh?
- learned how to use devtools to display realistic phone sizing
- great tutorial for learning good maintainability habits from, in the previous project, the .css file was huge, and it started to be a bit of a pain to navigate it and I wanted to learn a way to compartmentalize the components. So shoutout to freeCodeCamp and their learning path, since this video was right after that project. Looks like I'll be using a lot of SASS from now on.
